Copenhagen useR presentation
============================

R code from the Copenhagen useR meeting, February 16, 2016:

[There is no r in lasso, but plenty of lasso in R!](http://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenR-useR-Group/events/228068415/)

See the final [presentation](http://nielsrhansen.github.io/useR/lasso.html) for the result. 

The code for the presentation is
lasso.Rpres for RStudio, which generates an HTML presentation.

The `movie.R` file generates the gif animations.

The presentation contains my interpretation of some of the history 
of lasso and the development of suitable algorithms and R packages for 
computing the lasso solution.
