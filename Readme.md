Copenhagen useR presentation R code
===================================

[February 16, 2016.](http://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenR-useR-Group/events/228068415/)

See the final [presentation](http://nielsrhansen.github.io/useR/lasso.html) for the result. 

The code for the presentation is an 
R presentation for RStudio, which generates a HTML presentation.

The `movie.R` file generates the gif animations.

The presentation contains my interpretation of some of the history 
of lasso and the development of suitable algorithms and R packages for 
computing the lasso solution.
